# Topic: Deployment


**Kubernetes Deployment** is an object that helps you **run and manage your application automatically**.

It:

* Runs **multiple copies (replicas)** of your app
* **Restarts pods** if they crash (self-healing)
* **Scales up/down** easily
* Updates the app **without downtime** (rolling updates)
