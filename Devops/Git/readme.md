## What is Git?
Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)** that helps track changes, collaborate, and manage project versions efficiently.

## Uses of Git:
- **Tracks changes** – Keeps a history of code updates.
- **Collaboration** – Multiple developers can work together.
- **Branching & Merging** – Develop features independently.
- **Backup & Security** – Prevents data loss with local copies.

#### Que. Differnence between CVCS and DVCS

# CVCS vs. DVCS

Version control systems are categorized into **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)** and **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**.

## Differences:

| Feature | CVCS (Centralized Version Control System) | DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) |
|---------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Repository Location** | Single central server | Each user has a full copy of the repository |
| **Dependency on Server** | Requires constant server connection | Can work offline, changes sync later |
| **Performance** | Slower due to network dependency | Faster as operations are local |
| **Failure Handling** | If the server fails, all work stops | Multiple copies exist, reducing risk of data loss |
| **Merging & Branching** | Complex and resource-heavy | Lightweight and efficient |
| **Examples** | SVN, Perforce, CVS | Git, Mercurial, Bazaar |

## Github:
- GitHub is a cloud-based platform where developers store, share, and work together on code.
- It acts like a professional portfolio that tracks every change made to a project,
- ensuring teams stay organized and can revert to previous versions if a mistake happens
